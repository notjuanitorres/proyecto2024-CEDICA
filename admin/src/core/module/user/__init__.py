__init__.py

This module initializes the user package by importing and exposing key components
such as repositories, forms, and mappers. These components are used for managing
user data, including creating, editing, searching, and mapping user information.

Exposed Components:
    - AbstractUserRepository: The abstract base class for user repositories.
    - UserRepository: The concrete implementation of the user repository.
    - UserCreateForm: The form for creating a new user.
    - UserEditForm: The form for editing an existing user.
    - UserSearchForm: The form for searching users.
    - AccountSearchForm: The form for searching accounts.
    - AccountSelectForm: The form for selecting accounts.
    - UserMapper: The mapper for converting between user entities and data transfer objects (DTOs).
